## The Coral Reef Crisis
Coral reefs are home to innumerable species, form natural barriers to protect shorelines and coastal structures, and are valued on the order of hundreds of billions of dollars annually for the goods and services they provide. This immense productivity is based on the symbiotic relationship between the coral host and its photosynthetic endosymbiotic algae that generate and share carbon with the coral, enabling this partnership to engineer the carbonate reef foundation. Coral reefs, however, have been severely and negatively impacted by local stressors such as overfishing, coastal development, and pollution. Further, global climate change stressors such as marine heatwaves are driving a breakdown in the symbiotic relationship between corals and their algae, namely coral bleaching, which can lead to coral starvation and mass mortality. It is therefore critical to understand how both natural factors and human interventions1 impact coral resilience and coral reef ecosystem persistence. 

## Our Approaches:
1) Identify the thermal tolerance of key reef-building species across a wide biogeographic range. This will provide us with essential knowledge to better forecast reef futures.
2) Compare and contrast the molecular and cellular plasticity of corals with varying thermal tolerance across this biogeographic range. This will allow us to identify the stress response toolkit and metabolic phenotype of thermally tolerant corals.
3) Determine phenotypes, mechanisms, and longevity of the beneficial stress conditioning in corals. This information will help to fill knowledge gaps that are crucial to our understanding of how coral reef persistence will be impacted by climate change, in addition to enhancing the scientific background on which coral-assisted evolution and restoration efforts are based.
